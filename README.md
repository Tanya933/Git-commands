# Some basic Git commands are:

- git init                                           //initialize a git repository

- git status                                         // show the status of all the files in local repo

- git add .                                          // add all the files to the staging area

- git commit -m "your message about this commit"      // commit all the uncommitted files 

- git branch                                        //list all the branches

- git branch branch_name                            //create a branch with name branch_name

- git checkout branch_name                          //checkout the branch, branch_name

- git checkout -b branch_name

- git remote add upstream "link of remote repo"     //to setup upstream for a remote repo to your local repo
